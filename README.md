# Choose Your Own Adventure

Dive into an immersive console-based story game built with C#. The game showcases object-oriented principles by encapsulating player data and methods, and by structuring the game's flow using function calls.

## Technical Features:
1. Object-Oriented Design: The game uses the Player class to represent the player's character, encapsulating properties like Health, KindnessPoints, and methods like AddKindnessPoints. This allows for modular and maintainable code.
2. Function-based Flow: Different game scenarios are organized into functions, allowing easy modifications and expansions to the game's narrative.
3. Dynamic Player Interactions: Players can make decisions that affect the game's outcome, which is achieved using conditional statements and switch cases.
